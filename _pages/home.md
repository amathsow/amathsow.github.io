After graduating with a degree in Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, I worked for 3 years part time  as a 2G and 3G radio engineer at Huawei
Techologies. At the same time, I was involved in entrepreneurship, which allowed me to set up two startups in the field of health (www.karangue.com) and in agriculture (www.bayseddo.com). During this entrepreneurial period I had won a lot of prizes:

_ codecamp emerginov 2016

_ Orange developper challenge 2017

_ Startup Acceleration at Nest'up (www.nestup.com) in Belgium

_ vivatech prize Paris(www.vivatechnology.com/) and travel partnership with Orange Sillicon Valley

Currently, I am specialized in artificial intelligence and i'm mostly interested about Reinforcement Learning, autonomous navigation and multi agents system. As member of Intelligent Robot Learning(IRLab: Alberta), i'm working with <meta name= "Dr MAtt Taylor" http-equiv=refresh content="0;url=/new/index.html"> **Dr. Matt Taylor** on variance reduced gradient applied to convergent actor critic algorithm for high dimensional observations. I have also reproduced many human in the loop RL algorithms(Tamer, Deep Tamer, COACH, Deep COACH).
