After graduated in Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, I worked for 3 years part time  as a 3G and 4G radio engineer at Huawei
Techologies. At the same time, I was involved in entrepreneurship, which allowed me to set up two startups in the field of health (www.karangue.com) and in agriculture (www.bayseddo.com). During this entrepreneurial period I had won a lot of prizes:

_ codecamp emerginov 2016

_ Orange developper challenge 2017

_ Startup Acceleration at Nest'up (www.nestup.com) in Belgium

_ vivatech prize Paris(www.vivatechnology.com/) and travel partnership with Orange Sillicon Valley

Currently, I am doing a program at AMMI: African Master in Machine Intelligence sponsored by Google and Facebok and i'm mostly interested about Reinforcement Learning, autonomous navigation and multi agents system. As member of Intelligent Robot Learning(IRLab: Alberta), i'm working with  <a href="https://drmatttaylor.net/"> **Dr. Matt Taylor** </a>  on variance reduced gradient applied to convergent actor critic algorithm which is a HCLR where the human feedback is considered as a reward. The goal is to applyed to high dimensional observations and compare it to others algorithms (Deep Tamer, Deep COACH, etc).
