After graduated in Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, I worked for 3 years part time  as a 3G and 4G radio engineer at Huawei
Techologies. At the same time, I was involved in entrepreneurship, which allowed me to set up two startups in the field of health <a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/work-of-the-future/solutions/5380"> karangue </a> and in agriculture  <a href="https://bayseddo.com/"> Bayseddo </a>. During this entrepreneurial period I had won a lot of prizes:

_ codecamp emerginov 2016

_ Orange developper challenge 2017

_ Startup Acceleration at <a href="https://nestup.com.com/"> **Nest'up** </a>  in Belgium

_ <a href="https://vivatechnology.com/"> **vivatech** </a> prize Paris and travel partnership with Orange Sillicon Valley

Currently, I am doing a program at AMMI: African Master in Machine Intelligence sponsored by Google and Facebok and i'm mostly interested about Reinforcement Learning, autonomous navigation and multi agents system. As member of Intelligent Robot Learning(IRLab: Alberta), i'm working with  <a href="https://drmatttaylor.net/"> **Dr. Matt Taylor** </a>  on variance reduced gradient applied to convergent actor critic algorithm which is a HCLR where the human feedback is considered as a reward. The goal is to applyed to high dimensional observations and compare it to others algorithms (Deep Tamer, Deep COACH, etc).

## Projects

**Human in the Loop Reinforcement Learning framework:** Jully 2020 - Now

In Partnership with Intelligent Robot Learning(https://irll.ca/) i'm working on Building a framework for Human in the Loop algorithm(HCLR) under the supervision of **Dr. Matt Taylor**: Tamer, COACH, Deep Tamer, Deep COACH,... 

**Speech Recognition in Wolof:** June 2020 - Jully 2020

The goal of this project is to collect data in our local language and fine tunea phone classification model. For our case we will be using wolof. Wolof is alanguage of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, and the native language ofthe Wolof people. The successful completion of this project would have been much more difficult, if it wasn't for the generous support, provided by Professor Laurent Besacier, Univ. Grenoble Alpes. Thanks also to the Lig-Aikuma project for providing the platform to record and create this dataset.<a href="https://github.com/amathsow/wolof_speech_recognition"> **link to the project** </a>
