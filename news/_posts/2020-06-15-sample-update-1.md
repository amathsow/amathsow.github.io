Deep COACH is an improvement on the original COACH paper in order to learn high dimensional observation. So Intelligent agents must be able to learn complex behaviors as specified by (non-expert)human users.  Moreover, they will need to learn these behaviors within a reasonable amount of time while efficiently leveraging the sparse feed-back a human trainer is capable of providing.
