Variance Reduced COACH
---

In this paper, we propose an alternative interpretation of coach, in which we show that the human feedback can instead be thought of as replacing the reward signal typically present in RL. This fundamentally different interpretation of the human feedback then motivates us to consider adding to coach a variance-reduction strategy commonly used in RL. To this end, we propose and study vr-coach: a novel extension of coach that maintains an estimate of a value-like quantity, and then uses this estimate as a control variate in the learning algorithm.

## I. Motivation

The human feedback can instead be thought of as replacing the reward signal typically present in RL and adding on coach a variane reduced strategy.

## II. Episodic COACH
